PDF reader supports basic PDF logic:

1. Lexical objets (tokens)
2. File structure (how objects are stored, accessed and updated). No updates actually. Semantically independent.
3. Document structure
    (how basic object types are used to represent PDF components: pages, fonts, annotations, images etc.)
4. Content streams (instructions describing the appearance of a page or other graphical entity).
    A very limited support of text (plain, deflated, encoded) instructions only.
